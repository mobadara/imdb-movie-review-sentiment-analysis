        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates an end-to-end sentiment analysis solution built using PyTorch, focusing on a binary classification problem (positive vs. negative sentiment). The primary objective of this submission is to showcase proficiency in key deep learning concepts and practical PyTorch implementation skills, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Data Handling with Pandas and PyTorch:** Efficiently loading, processing, and transforming data from a Pandas DataFrame into PyTorch `TensorDataset` and `DataLoader` for effective batch processing.\n",
        "* **Comprehensive Text Preprocessing:** Implementing robust text cleaning techniques, including HTML tag removal, lowercasing, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization, crucial for preparing raw text for neural network input.\n",
        "* **Vocabulary Management and Embedding Preparation:** Building a custom vocabulary and converting textual data into numerical sequences suitable for embedding layers. This includes handling padding and unknown tokens.\n",
        "* **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Architecture Design:** Constructing and training a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a powerful variant of RNNs, specifically tailored for sequential data like natural language. The model will leverage an embedding layer for dense word representations.\n",
        "* **PyTorch Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementing a complete training loop, defining appropriate loss functions (Binary Cross-Entropy), optimizers (Adam), and evaluating model performance (accuracy) on a held-out test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset for this task consists of reviews with a perfectly balanced class distribution, providing an ideal scenario for training and validating a sentiment classifier. This notebook serves as a comprehensive demonstration of the entire machine learning pipeline, from raw data to a trained predictive model, using the PyTorch framework.\n",

        "## **Theoretical Background: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, speech, or time series. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, RNNs have connections that allow information to flow in a loop, enabling them to maintain an internal state (or \"memory\") that captures information about previous elements in the sequence. This \"memory\" makes them particularly well-suited for tasks involving sequential data where the context of past elements is crucial for understanding the current one.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Introduction: The Challenge of Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**\n",
        "\n",
        "A significant challenge with vanilla RNNs is the problem of **vanishing or exploding gradients**. During backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is how RNNs learn, gradients can either become extremely small (vanishing) or extremely large (exploding) as they propagate through many time steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Vanishing gradients** make it difficult for the network to learn long-range dependencies, as the influence of earlier inputs on the current output diminishes over time.\n",
        "* **Exploding gradients** lead to unstable training and large weight updates, potentially causing the model to diverge.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks**\n",
        "\n",
        "To address the vanishing gradient problem, **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** were introduced. LSTMs are a special type of RNN that are capable of learning long-term dependencies. They achieve this through a sophisticated internal structure called a \"cell state\" and several \"gates\" that regulate the flow of information into and out of the cell state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each LSTM unit consists of:\n",
        "* **Forget Gate:** Decides what information to throw away from the cell state.\n",
        "* **Input Gate:** Decides what new information to store in the cell state.\n",
        "* **Output Gate:** Decides what part of the cell state to output.\n",
        "\n",
        "These gates are typically composed of a sigmoid neural net layer and a pointwise multiplication operation. The sigmoid layer outputs numbers between 0 and 1, describing how much of each component should be let through. A value of 0 means \"don't let anything through,\" while a value of 1 means \"let everything through.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "By intelligently controlling the flow of information, LSTMs can preserve relevant information over long sequences, making them highly effective for tasks like sentiment analysis, machine translation, and speech recognition."
